## Description
This web application displays the courses I've studied thus far at Miun. 
The courses are stored in a MySQL database and the application uses a PHP REST API 
to communicate with the database. It is also possible to add, delete and edit courses.
Refresh the browser in order to see the changes you've made. The application can be found [here](http://studenter.miun.se/~mazi2001/writeable/dt173g/moment5/webbplats/index.html) as well as on [GitHub Pages](https://marzin89.github.io/miun-courses/index.html).
